<p align="center"><b><font size="18">SVG Icon Tool</font></b></p><p></p><p>Drag a SVG file to the <b>Icon</b> card to see the file and path.  Click the open folder icon or double click the file name field to select a file.</p><p></p><p>Drag a folder of SVG files to the <b>Family</b> card to get a list.  You can arrow up/down though the list to view icons individually.  Click the open folder icon or double click the family path field to select a folder.</p><p></p><p>The <b>Grid</b> card displays 80 icons per page.  Use left/right arrow keys to navigate to previous/next pages of icons.  Use up/down arrow keys to change families of imported icons.</p><p></p><p>Click on icons to select them.  Selected icons can be copied and pasted into another stack (only visible icons are copied).  Double-click an icon to copy the icon widget to the clipboard.</p><p></p><p>An individual family can be saved or deleted from this card using the appropriate buttons.  The filled star selects all icons in the family (including those not visible).  The hollow star de-selects all icons.  The duplicate icon will create a new (or add to an existing) family containing the selected icons.</p><p></p><p>The <b>Library</b> card allow for icon families to be loaded into the SVG Icon Library (requires 9.0rc1 or later).  It also allows the setting of the current icon family which is used in other widgets for choosing icons.</p><p></p><p>Multiple family export files can be dragged onto the card to import them into the tool.</p><p></p><p>If you used the icon picker to select an icon and then change to a different family, you may not see what you expect.  The icons are displayed from the current family and if not there then the other families are searched (no guarantee on order).  The first name match is the one used.  This is why there is an option to prepend the family when copying icons since it will avoid this issue.</p><p></p><p><a>https://milby.us/lc/SvgIconTool.zip</a> is an earlier copy with many icons from <a>https://github.com/leungwensen/svg-icon</a> included.  This stack can also be found at <a>https://github.com/bwmilby/SvgIconTool</a> with the same set of icons available for install.</p>
